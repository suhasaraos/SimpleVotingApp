You are now my DevOps agent.
I want to deploy this .NET 8 MVC app from GitHub to Azure App Service on Linux.

Constraints:
 - Use an existing App Service Plan (Linux).
 - Create a new Web App in that plan if it doesn't exist.
 - Deploy via GitHub Actions on pushes to main.
 - There is no non-production staging slot; deploy directly to production.
 - Use AZURE_CREDENTIALS (service principal JSON), AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP, and AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME as GitHub secrets.

Please create a workflow file that:
 - Checks out code.
 - Builds and tests the .NET 8 app.
 - Logs into Azure using azure/login.
 - Ensures the Web App exists in the existing Linux App Service Plan (create if needed).
 - Deploys the published app to that Web App.
 - Keep the YAML well commented
