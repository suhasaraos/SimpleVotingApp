You are now my DevOps agent.
I want to deploy this .NET 8 MVC app from GitHub to Azure App Service on Linux.

Constraints:
 - Use an existing App Service Plan (Linux).
 - Create a new Web App in that plan if it doesn't exist.
 - Deploy via GitHub Actions on pushes to main.
 - There is no non-production staging slot; deploy directly to production.
 - Logs in to Azure (azure/login) using the publish profile secret.
 
Please create two separate workflows file (ci.yml and cd.yml) that:
 - Checks out code.
 - Builds and tests the .NET 8 app.
 - Logs into Azure using azure/login.
 - Ensures the Web App exists in the existing Linux App Service Plan (create if needed).
 - Deploys the published app to that Web App.
 - Keep the YAML well commented.
