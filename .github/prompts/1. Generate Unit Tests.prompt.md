You are my test agent.
- This is a .NET 8 MVC app with a VotingController handling a simple voting flow.
- Create a new xUnit test project in this solution called MyApp.Tests.
- Add basic unit tests for VotingController that only cover the happy path:
- Index returns the view with the question and options.
- Vote stores a valid vote and redirects/returns the results view.
- Keep it simple; no mocks or complex setups.
- Please generate the new test project and test class files.
